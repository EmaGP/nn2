"I have worked with Python since my university days. I like it because, unlike other statistical software like ‘R,’ Python can also be used for automations, API connections, and especially machine learning.
I am familiar with several Python libraries, including the main ones: Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. But I also know other libraries like Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, and more.
Pandas is a library used for data manipulation. It reads data and stores it in a dataframe. You can create columns, delete rows, aggregate data, and do many other things. However, I also know a library that is faster than Pandas. It’s called Polars, and it serves the same purpose but is more efficient.
Polars is a relatively new library, but it’s excellent and fast.
I have a good understanding of SQL, and I’ve used it in all my jobs. It’s part of my daily work routine. Additionally, I consider myself an expert in Excel. I can use formulas, pivot tables, Power Query, and Power Pivot. For data visualization, I enjoy working with Power BI, and I’ve created many dashboards using it."
